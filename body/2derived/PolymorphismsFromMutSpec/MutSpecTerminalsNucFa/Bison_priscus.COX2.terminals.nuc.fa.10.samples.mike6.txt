Input file: /home/popadin/MtDnaRecombination/body/2derived/PolymorphismsFromMutSpec/MutSpecTerminalsNucFa/temp6.txt

More than 2 alleles segregating at position :
71 - 
These positions were removed from LD-distance analysis


Number of sequences:10 
Number of aligned nucleotides :681 

Number of polymorphic sites:12


---- PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT BETWEEN LINKAGE DESEQUILIBRIUM MEASURED AS R SQUARE AND DISTANCE ----

	Correlation coefficient : 0.069
	P-value : 0.663
	Number of randomizations : 1000
