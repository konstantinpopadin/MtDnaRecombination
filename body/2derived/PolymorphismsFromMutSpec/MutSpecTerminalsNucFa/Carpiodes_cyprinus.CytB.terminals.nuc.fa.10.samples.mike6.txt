Input file: /home/popadin/MtDnaRecombination/body/2derived/PolymorphismsFromMutSpec/MutSpecTerminalsNucFa/temp6.txt

More than 2 alleles segregating at position :
500 - 
These positions were removed from LD-distance analysis


Number of sequences:10 
Number of aligned nucleotides :1134 

Number of polymorphic sites:25


---- PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT BETWEEN LINKAGE DESEQUILIBRIUM MEASURED AS R SQUARE AND DISTANCE ----

	Correlation coefficient : 0.045
	P-value : 0.722
	Number of randomizations : 1000


|D'| ------------------------------ IS EQUAL TO ONE FOR MOST PAIRS OF SITES------------------------------ 
------------------------------ NOT ENOUGH DATA TO ESTIMATE PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT WITH LD MEASURED AS |D'|------------------------------
