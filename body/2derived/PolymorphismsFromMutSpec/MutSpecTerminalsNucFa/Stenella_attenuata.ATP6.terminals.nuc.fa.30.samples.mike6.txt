Input file: /home/popadin/MtDnaRecombination/body/2derived/PolymorphismsFromMutSpec/MutSpecTerminalsNucFa/temp6.txt

More than 2 alleles segregating at position :
36 - 63 - 117 - 137 - 140 - 176 - 185 - 194 - 221 - 249 - 263 - 296 - 329 - 332 - 410 - 453 - 473 - 
These positions were removed from LD-distance analysis


Number of sequences:30 
Number of aligned nucleotides :663 

Number of polymorphic sites:22


---- PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT BETWEEN LINKAGE DESEQUILIBRIUM MEASURED AS R SQUARE AND DISTANCE ----

	Correlation coefficient : 0.070
	P-value : 0.847
	Number of randomizations : 1000


|D'| ------------------------------ IS EQUAL TO ONE FOR MOST PAIRS OF SITES------------------------------ 
------------------------------ NOT ENOUGH DATA TO ESTIMATE PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT WITH LD MEASURED AS |D'|------------------------------
