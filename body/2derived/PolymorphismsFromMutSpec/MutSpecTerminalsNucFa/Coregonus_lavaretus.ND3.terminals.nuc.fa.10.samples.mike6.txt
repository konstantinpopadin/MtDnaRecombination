Input file: /home/popadin/MtDnaRecombination/body/2derived/PolymorphismsFromMutSpec/MutSpecTerminalsNucFa/temp6.txt

More than 2 alleles segregating at position :
334 - 
These positions were removed from LD-distance analysis


Number of sequences:10 
Number of aligned nucleotides :348 

Number of polymorphic sites:10


---- PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT BETWEEN LINKAGE DESEQUILIBRIUM MEASURED AS R SQUARE AND DISTANCE ----

	Correlation coefficient : -0.163
	P-value : 0.132
	Number of randomizations : 1000


|D'| ------------------------------ IS EQUAL TO ONE FOR MOST PAIRS OF SITES------------------------------ 
------------------------------ NOT ENOUGH DATA TO ESTIMATE PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT WITH LD MEASURED AS |D'|------------------------------
