Input file: /home/popadin/MtDnaRecombination/body/2derived/PolymorphismsFromMutSpec/MutSpecTerminalsNucFa/temp6.txt

More than 2 alleles segregating at position :
86 - 380 - 434 - 581 - 593 - 1265 - 1394 - 1572 - 1616 - 1760 - 1778 - 1790 - 
These positions were removed from LD-distance analysis


Number of sequences:20 
Number of aligned nucleotides :1818 

Number of polymorphic sites:23


---- PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT BETWEEN LINKAGE DESEQUILIBRIUM MEASURED AS R SQUARE AND DISTANCE ----

	Correlation coefficient : 0.016
	P-value : 0.547
	Number of randomizations : 1000
